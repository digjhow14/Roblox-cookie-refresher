# Roblox Cookie Refresher
This repository contains a Python script designed to refresh Roblox cookies. The script reads cookies from a file, logs in using those cookies, and generates new valid cookies for the same accounts.

# Requirements
Python 3.x
requests library
pyperclip library (automatically installed if not present)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roblox-cookie-refresher.git
cd roblox-cookie-refresher
Install the required libraries:

bash
pip install requests pyperclip
Usage
Prepare a file named cookies.txt in the root directory of the project. This file should contain the cookies you want to refresh, each on a new line.

Run the script:

bash
python refresher.py
The script will read the cookies from cookies.txt, refresh them, and write the new cookies to Rcookies.txt.

# Script Overview
Bypass Class
The Bypass class is responsible for handling the cookie refresh process. It includes methods to get CSRF tokens, authentication tickets, and the final valid cookies.

__init__(self, cookie): Initializes the class with a cookie.
start_process(self): Starts the process to get a refreshed cookie.
get_set_cookie(self): Retrieves the set-cookie header from the response.
get_rbx_authentication_ticket(self): Gets the Roblox authentication ticket.
get_csrf_token(self): Gets the CSRF token.
Main Function
The main() function handles the overall process:

Installs the pyperclip library if not present.
Reads cookies from cookies.txt.
Processes each cookie to get a refreshed one.
Writes the refreshed cookies to Rcookies.txt.

# Handling Dependencies
The script includes a function install_pyperclip() to ensure the pyperclip library is installed.

# Error Handling
The script includes basic error handling to manage issues like file not found errors and invalid cookies.

Example cookies.txt File
cookie1

cookie3
Each line in the cookies.txt file should contain a single cookie.
